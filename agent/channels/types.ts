/**
 * ChatTransport — the platform-agnostic chat interface for the Pager agent.
 *
 * Design: DI + small required core + optional capability interfaces (mautrix
 * bridgev2 pattern). One transport is constructed at `cta start` time, selected
 * by CTA_CHANNEL (default "telegram"). The poller feature-detects optional
 * capabilities (`if (isReactable(t)) …`) so a platform that lacks a feature
 * (e.g. LINE has no reactions) simply omits the interface instead of shipping
 * silent no-op landmines.
 *
 * Full rationale + per-platform method walkthrough: docs/plans/chat-transport-interface.md.
 *
 * STATUS: P2 (1/n) — the contract only. Nothing imports this yet; the poller
 * still calls the Telegram adapter directly. P2 (2/n) adds the TelegramTransport
 * implementation; P3 cuts the poller over to this interface.
 *
 * This module is platform-agnostic: it MUST NOT import any channels/<platform>/
 * code, so adding a platform never edits the core.
